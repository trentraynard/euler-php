// The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. 
// So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. 
// The first ten terms would be:
// 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

// 1: 1
// 3: 1,3
// 6: 1,2,3,6
// 10: 1,2,5,10
// 15: 1,3,5,15
// 21: 1,3,7,21
// 28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
// We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.


// What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
